# CornerGrocer
The Corner Grocer project was designed to help a grocery store track the frequency of items purchased by customers. The program reads a file of grocery items, processes the data, and allows the user to view results in multiple ways, such as item frequencies, search results, and a histogram display. This solved the problem of keeping better track of customer buying trends in a simple, text-based program.

What I Did Well

I organized the program with a clean menu system that let users easily choose between different options. I also paid close attention to error handling so the program doesnâ€™t crash when unexpected input is entered. Overall, I made sure the program was readable and easy to follow.

Areas for Improvement

I could enhance the program by making the data storage more efficient. For example, instead of relying on basic text file input/output, I could use a database or even JSON to store the inventory, which would improve performance and scalability. Adding more robust search features, like case-insensitive lookups or partial matches, would also make the program more user-friendly.

Challenges and How I Overcame Them

One of the hardest parts was handling file input and making sure the program worked smoothly even if the input file had errors or formatting issues. I overcame this by testing the program with different input scenarios and using try/catch blocks for exceptions. Resources like course materials, documentation, and debugging practice were all important in solving these challenges.

Transferable Skills

This project gave me stronger skills in C++ file handling, input validation, and using data structures like maps for frequency counting. These skills will transfer well into future projects, especially those that involve data processing or building menu-driven applications.

Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability

To make the program easier to maintain, I structured it into clear functions, each handling one task. I added comments to explain the logic, and I kept variable names descriptive. This will make it easier to adapt or extend the program in the future, such as by connecting it to a database or adding a graphical user interface.
